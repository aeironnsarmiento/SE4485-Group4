# VSCode Environment Transfer Tool

The VSCode Environment Transfer Tool is a Python-based utility designed to package and unpackage Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environments, enabling you to easily transfer your development environment between different machines or backups. This tool provides a graphical interface for packaging and unpackaging using PySimpleGUI.

- **Progress Bar:** Real-time progress bar showing packaging and unpackaging progress.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- PySimpleGUI
- Required Python modules: `os`, `shutil`, `zipfile`, `threading`, `sys`, and `time`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
